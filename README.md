A bounding-volume hierarchy for in-game broad-phase *collision detection* in rust


## Features

* Fast insertion and removal
* Fast iteration over overlaping pairs
* Efficient reuse of memory when volumes are removed (backed by a generational-arena storage)


## Non-goals

This library does *not* attempt to be optimal for:

* ray-tracing (though, basic ray-cast may eventually be supported)
* static scenes

## How usage looks like

```rust
use bvh_arena::{Bvh, volumes::Aabb};
use glam::Vec2; // <-- You may use any math library, or even none.

// Create a bounding volume hierarchy
let mut bvh: Bvh<u8, Aabb<2>> = Bvh::default();

// Insert a bounding volume
let id = bvh.insert(1, Aabb::from_min_max(Vec2::ZERO, Vec2::new(1.0, 1.0)));

// Remove a bounding volume
bvh.remove(id);

// Iteration over overlaping pairs
bvh.for_each_overlaping_pair(|a, b| println!("{a} overlaps {b}"));
```

## `no_std` support

This crate is `no_std` compatible but requires a [global allocator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html).


## Installation

Add to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
bvh-arena = "1"
```

## MSRV

The minimum supported rust version is currently: `1.58`

**It *may* be increased to a newer stable version in a minor release.** (but only if needed)

It *will* be increased to the latest stable version in a major release. (even if not needed)


## Motivation

In the context of building my own collision detection logic, I wanted to use a bounding-volume-hierarchy (BVH)
for the broad-phase.

But it seamed that most of the existing BVH implementations are biased toward the ray-tracing use-case. 
And that means, they provide different API, algorithms and trade-offs than what I am looking for.
